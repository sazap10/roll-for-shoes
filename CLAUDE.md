# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Non-Negotiables

- If a Foundry API pattern isn't in the reference files, search before writing — not after
- If a call can't be verified, flag it explicitly rather than guessing
- Always write a descriptive commit message

## Project Overview

Roll for Shoes is a **Foundry VTT game system supporting v13 and v14** — a pure JavaScript/Handlebars/CSS project with no build step, no package.json, and no external dependencies. Files are loaded directly by Foundry. There are no compile, test, or lint commands.

To develop, copy/symlink the repo into your Foundry `Data/systems/roll-for-shoes/` folder and reload Foundry in the browser.

## Architecture

### Entry Point

`roll-for-shoes.mjs` wires together all Foundry hooks:
- `init`: registers sheets, settings, document classes
- `ready`: auto-creates PC folder if absent; renders `RfsDcTracker` then `RfsPcDisplay`; registers actor lifecycle hooks; socket listener (`system.roll-for-shoes`) — handles `splashShow` only
- `preCreateActor`: sets prototype token linking
- `renderChatMessageHTML`: **all** interactive chat card button wiring

### Critical Patterns

**DC Tracker**: The persistent card (`RfsDcTracker`) is rendered for all users on `ready`. The GM adjusts the global DC via named tier chips or +/− step buttons. Players see the value read-only. DC is stored in `game.settings.get("roll-for-shoes", "globalDc")` (world-scoped, GM-only writes). `_resolveDifficulty()` reads this value unless `options.difficulty` is passed explicitly.

**PC Display**: `RfsPcDisplay` is a separate app rendered immediately after the DC tracker. It reads all actors from the folder named in the `pcFolder` world setting (default `"PCs"`, auto-created on first GM load). Portraits are deduped by actorId. Single click pans the canvas to the character's token and selects it; double-click opens the sheet (owner/GM only). Re-renders via `createActor`, `updateActor` (folder changes), and `deleteActor` hooks — all GM-only to avoid duplicate triggers. Deleting a PC actor also cleans up all its tokens across every scene. Positioned dynamically in `_onRender` by measuring `rfs-dc-tracker`'s right edge + 16 px.

**Roll Result Popup**: All rolls show a `RfsRollResultDialog` fire-and-forget popup. No chat card is posted until an advancement or XP-spend action completes. The popup handles Claim Skill and Spend XP inline. Results are always recorded to the actor's roll history flag (max 50).

**Advancement announcement card**: Posted to public chat whenever a skill is gained. Built by `buildAdvancementCardContent()` in `settings.mjs`. Static — no interactive elements.

**Button Wiring via `renderChatMessageHTML`**: Every interactive chat card button uses a `[data-action]` attribute and is wired in the `renderChatMessageHTML` hook. Active actions: `rfsOpenSheet`, `rfsClaimAdvancement`, `rfsSpendXp`. Roll result popup actions (`claimSkill`, `spendXp`) live in `RfsRollResultDialog.DEFAULT_OPTIONS.actions` — not here.

**Foundry v14 Sheet Pattern**: Sheets use `HandlebarsApplicationMixin(ActorSheetV2)` with `DEFAULT_OPTIONS`, `PARTS`, `_prepareContext()`, and `submitOnChange: true` for auto-save.

### Core Rules (see `src/helpers/config.mjs`)

- Root skill: "Do Anything 1" (immutable)
- Roll: dice count = skill level; meet-or-beat DC (ties go to roller)
- All sixes → player names a new child skill at level +1
- Failure → earn 1 XP; spend XP (1 per non-six die) to force advancement without a full-six roll
- DC scale: Easy 3 / Medium 6 / Hard 9 / Elite 12 / Legendary 15 / Mythic 18 (standard); Easy 4 / Medium 8 / Hard 12 / Elite 16 / Legendary 20 / Mythic 24 (More XP)

### Theme System

Add a theme by: creating `styles/themes/<name>.css` → adding a CSS custom property overrides file → registering in `config.mjs` → adding lang key in `lang/en.json` → listing in `system.json`.

All CSS values use custom properties from `styles/rfs-base.css` — no hardcoded colours or sizes.

## Key Files for Context

- **`RFS-Architecture.md`** — Design decisions, roll flow, advancement dialogs, button wiring rationale
- **`RFS-File-Structure.md`** — Full directory map, chat card types, key relationships
- **`RFS-Milestones.md`** — Progress tracking, current dev state, rules reference
- **`Foundry-v14-API.md`** — Verified Foundry v14 API patterns (header controls, lifecycle hooks, deprecations). Check this before writing any Foundry core API call.

## Current Development State

Core mechanics, roll UX, and advancement flow are complete and table-tested. Active work:
1. **Portrait display** — PC portraits in `RfsPcDisplay` are not displaying correctly; this is the current work item
2. Advancement prompt text branching — natural all-sixes vs. XP-purchased flavour text on the announcement card
3. Further CSS/visual polish as needed after table testing

**Socket pattern** (important): world-scoped settings can only be written by GMs. The only socket message type is `splashShow` (broadcast roll flourish to other clients). `"socket": true` must be in `system.json` and requires a full world reload (not just browser refresh) to take effect.

**XP spend cost** (important): spend cost is `nonSixCount` (non-six dice), NOT `dice.length`. `xpCost` is passed explicitly from `RfsSkillRoll.roll()` into `RfsVerdictDialog` so UI display and `spendXp()` use the same value.
